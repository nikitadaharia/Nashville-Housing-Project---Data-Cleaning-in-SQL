# Nashville-Housing-Project---Data-Cleaning-in-SQL

In this project, data is cleaned for Nashville Housing to make it more usable and standardized. Housing data was downloaded from Kaggle and imported to SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). Using Convert, the data format was standardized. Substring CHARINDEX was used to populate the Property address, duplicates were removed using rownumberCTE, and unused columns were removed.
